# jquilar.js

jquilar.js is a jquery-ui wrapper library for Angular2.

If 3rd party libraries with an imperative API can be wrapped as Angular2 components with a more declarative API, then it cleans up the application structure.

Everything continues to be components within components with data binding

Currently tested with:
- Angular 2.0.0-beta.0
- jQuery UI 1.11.4
- jQuery 1.10.2

### Supported Widgets (more coming soon)
- Slider
- Date Picker
- Progress Bar
- Sortable
- Menu
- Effect
- Accordion
- Tooltip
